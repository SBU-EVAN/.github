### Preface
Welcome! I am a graduate student at Stony Brook University studying cosmological tensions. I started this project in February 2022. This is the repository containing code for the work on my (currently unnamed) thesis.

# Introduction
The standard model of cosmology is $\Lambda$ cold dark matter \($\Lambda$CDM\). In this theory, dark matter behaves as a a cosmological constant, which appears as $\Lambda$ in Einstein's equation. The 'cold' property of dark matter means it is non-relativistic and dark meaning it is weakly coupled to the standard model of particle physics. $\Lambda$CDM has a 6-dimensional parameterization as follows:
- $\Omega_b$, the ratio of baryon density to critical density.
- $\Omega_c$, the ratio of dark matter density to critical density.
- $H_0$, the Hubble constant.
- $\tau$, the optical depth at reionization
- $n_s$, the matter power spectrum spectral index
- $\log(A_s)$, the amplitude of matter fluctuations
This parameterization is not unique, however. These are the parameters which we sample in this project.

From these parameters there are two that are in notable tension. The most well-known is the Hubble tension. Experiments measuring $H_0$ from the 'early' universe using the cosmic microwave background (CMB) yield different results that experiments from the 'late' universe using weak lensing.
